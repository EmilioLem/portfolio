        <p>Let's be honest, <b>none of us can remember everything</b> we need, but some of us go further the basic needs, at a point when we have a complete list of how to do things we already do commonly. If you're like me, maybe you can use <b>this compilation</b> to get up to speed, and <b>start learning quickly</b>.</p>

        <h3>How to publish a game online, easily</h3>
        <p>You might be finishing a game, or doing common coding practices on a <a href="https://learn.unity.com/">unity course</a>, in which they ask you you share your work.</p>
        <p>Â¿But how?</p>
        <p>Well, it's easier than you thing, just follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Once in Unity, go to "File" -> "Build Settings..." and <b></b>switch</b> the platform to <i>WebGL</i>. If not listed, "Add open scenes" (maybe all, maybe just the ones you want).</li>
          <li>Look in the top bar for "window" -> "Package Manager", switch the top left selector to <i>Unity registry</i> and in the top right search bar, look for <i>"WebGL Publisher</i>. It autocompletes. Then install</li>
          <li>In the top bar, a new option should appear: "Publish". Inside it there's a single option. Click, then publish the scene, and it is VERY IMPORTANT that you select a folder made by yourself, outside the current unity project, otherwise it won't let you to publish automatically to the web.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! It will open the game on <a href="https://play.unity.com/">unity play</a>, the link of which you can share with your friends and family.</p>
        <p>Later on, if you sign up with your Unity ID, you will find your latest games <a href="https://play.unity.com/">there</a>.</p>
